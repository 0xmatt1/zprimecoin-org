What is zPrime?
--------------

[zPrime](https://zprimecoin.com/) is a fork of Zcash but with Primecoin Proof of Work.


This software is the zPrime client. It downloads and stores the entire history
of zPrime transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network
connection, the synchronization process could take a day or more once the
blockchain has reached a significant size.

**zPrime is experimental and a work-in-progress.** Use at your own risk.

### Building

Build zPrime along with most dependencies from source by running:

```
./zputil/build.sh -j$(nproc)
```

Currently only Linux is officially supported.
